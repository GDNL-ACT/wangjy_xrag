The communities are named after George Rogers Clark, who was a military leader and a pioneer in the state of Missouri; Thomas Hart Benton, who was a painter and a congressman; John Clark, who was a pioneer and a farmer; and Clark M. Clark, who was a businessman and a philanthropist. The building is also home to the Murray State College Foundation. The foundation is a non-profit organization that raises funds for the college. The foundation is responsible for the Clark Murray Residence Hall and the Clark Murray Residence Hall Scholarship. The Clark Murray Residence Hall Scholarship is a four-year scholarship that is awarded to a student who is a resident of the Clark Murray Residence Hall. The scholarship is awarded to a student who has a 3.0 grade point average and who is a resident of the Clark Murray Residence Hall.",

Remotely operated underwater vehicles are now used with and without submersibles to see the deepest areas of the ocean that would be too dangerous for humans.

      "reference": "A Lightning Sketch (Dessinateur) was a series of four 1896 French short silent films directed by Georges Méliès and released by his Star Film Company. Each film showed an artist—very probably Méliès himself—drawing a caricature of a notable political figure in less than a minute. Three similar films were also made at about the same time, in August 1896, by the Anglo-American filmmaker J. Stuart Blackton, as a series called Blackton Sketches; Blackton would later make another film in the same vein, The Enchanted Drawing (1900). Méliès returned to sketching on film in his 1903 short The Untamable Whiskers, in which the process of drawing comic faces on a blackboard was undercranked so as to seem to occur with great speed. Numerous political caricatures by Méliès, presumably similar to those made in the A Lightning Sketch films, survive in the collection of the Centre national du cinéma. All four films in the A Lightning Sketch series are currently presumed lost.",

Its 40 barracks housed five thousand French prisoners of war captured during the Battle of France. According to Robert Christophe, in his making-of booklet on the film, Oflag XVII-A had a Gaullist resistance group called \"La Maffia\", which had ties to a French Resistance group (apparently the only such collaboration between prisoners outside France and resistance inside it), and thus acquired the materials for the camera (and supplies for escape attempts). Taking advantage of humanitarian packages from France, the prisoners smuggled in materials necessary for the construction and operation of a camera. Film was sent from France in packets with food for prisoners; they were hidden in sausages and other foods, and after being developed the negatives were hidden in the heels of the prisoners' boots (the footage documents such detail). Fourteen rolls were filmed by March 1945. The camera was made from a wooden box, which was hidden in a Larousse dictionary; the spine of this dictionary was capable of being opened like a shutter.",

The film was made in the camp's underground cinema, which was built by the prisoners using materials that were smuggled in.

Moreover, he discussed what he considered a middle way between laxity and cruelty in the treatment of slaves by their masters, averring that \"if not kept in hand, [slaves] are insolent, and think that they are as good as their masters, and, if harshly treated, they hate and conspire against them.\"",

Because no one — agitated, drugged, under whatever influence — would get on the plane at any cost. That will not happen.

By the end of the 15th century, Venice had become a major centre of printing.

At Cetinje, the capital of Zeta, Makarije printed in 1494 the Cetinje Octoechos, the first incunable written in the Serbian recension of Church Slavonic. The Crnojević printing house worked until 1496, when Zeta fell to the Ottomans.

One particular element that runs through the entirety of Opeth's discography is copiously present: those ominous riffs and a sense of moody, brooding emotionality. It certainly won't be enough to appease Opeth fans infuriated by Heritage (or, if you go further back, by the polarizing Watershed), but it will intrigue and appease those willing to accept the band's expanded sound.\" Pitchfork's Grayson",
      "prediction": "ained album, but it's also a more focused one. The band's signature ethereal, atmospheric sound is still present, but it's often punctuated by heavier, more aggressive moments. The album's longest track, \"Palisander,\" is a 12-minute epic that is as beautiful as it is complex. It's a testament to the band's ability to create intricate, multi-layered music that is still accessible to the listener. The album's other standout tracks include \"Inhaler,\" \"The Alchemist,\" and \"Opposite,\" which are all catchy and memorable in their own right. The album's only real flaw is that it's not quite as adventurous as its predecessor. It's a solid album, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of Pale Communion. It's also worth noting that the album is a bit longer than it needs to be. At 52 minutes, it's a bit of a marathon, and some of the tracks could have been edited down to make the album more concise. Overall, though, Kemper's Pitchfork review sums it up best: \"The album is a testament to the band's ability to create intricate, multi-layered music that is still accessible to the listener. It's a worthy follow-up to Pale Communion, and it's a reminder that Opeth is still one of the most innovative and exciting bands in heavy music.\"",

While binary search halves the search space after each comparison, one-sided search doubles the search space after each comparison. Specifically, on the kth iteration of one-sided search (assuming x > y), the interval under consideration is A[j, j+2k-1]. Expansion halts as soon as A[j + 2k-1] ≥ x, at which point this interval is binary searched for x. If one-sided search takes k iterations to find an interval that contains x, then it follows that d > 2k-2. Binary searching this range will also take another k iterations. Therefore, finger search for x from y takes O(k) = O(log d) time.",

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction in 1934 of the Newman Cutoff, which created Chotard Lake and Albemarle Lake, both oxbow lakes, and removed Brunswick from the contiguous Mississippi River.
