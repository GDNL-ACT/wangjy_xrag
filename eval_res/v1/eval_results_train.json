Those biocomposites are meant to be a real alternative to low-gloss standard ABS grades at a competitive cost.

      "reference": "Marine biology is a hybrid subject that combines aspects of organismal function, ecological interaction and the study of marine biodiversity. The earliest studies of marine biology trace back to the Phoenicians and the Greeks who are known as the initial explorers of the oceans and their composition. The first recorded observations on the distribution and habits of marine life were made by Aristotle (384–322 BC). Observations made in the earliest studies of marine biology provided an impetus for the age of discovery and exploration that followed. During this time, a vast amount of knowledge was gained about life that exists in the oceans. Individuals who contributed significantly to this pool of knowledge include Captain James Cook (1728–1779), Charles Darwin (1809–1882)",

The first observations of marine organisms were made by early explorers and sailors who were interested in the practical applications of the sea. Aristotle, who is considered the father of marine biology, was the first to study the biology of marine organisms. He was followed by a number of other pioneers, including Charles Darwin, who studied the distribution of marine organisms and their adaptations to the marine environment.

In 2010, with Dr. Zimri Yaseen he described a suicide-specific clinical syndrome, the Suicide Crisis Syndrome (SCS), initially known as Suicide Trigger State. This finding was later replicated in three other studies. In high-risk suicidal inpatients, high scores in the Suicide Crisis Inventory (SCI) were strongly predictive of suicidal behavior within one-two months after discharge. The core feature of SCS is the persistent and desperate feeling of entrapment, which is urgency to escape or avoid an unbearable life situation when escape is perceived as impossible (Typical situations would include terminal illness, humiliating failure at work, or rejection by a romantic partner). In addition, the SCS involves affective disturbance, loss of cognitive control, hyperarousal and social withdrawal.

Cetus, the sea monster defeated by the hero, is shown below. This painting probably remained in Rubens' house until his death; an engraving from 1684, depicting the facade of Rubens' house in Antwerp, shows the painting through the window of the second floor.

      "reference": "A Lightning Sketch (Dessinateur) was a series of four 1896 French short silent films directed by Georges Méliès and released by his Star Film Company. Each film showed an artist—very probably Méliès himself—drawing a caricature of a notable political figure in less than a minute. Three similar films were also made at about the same time, in August 1896, by the Anglo-American filmmaker J. Stuart Blackton, as a series called Blackton Sketches; Blackton would later make another film in the same vein, The Enchanted Drawing (1900). Méliès returned to sketching on film in his 1903 short The Untamable Whiskers, in which the process of drawing comic faces on a blackboard was undercranked so as to seem to occur with great speed. Numerous political caricatures by Méliès, presumably similar to those made in the A Lightning Sketch films, survive in the collection of the Centre national du cinéma. All four films in the A Lightning Sketch series are currently presumed lost.",

It is a drawing sketch of a man, a woman, and a dog, which is animated by Méliès's use of a stroboscope. The film is a precursor to Méliès's later films, which used stop-motion animation. The film was also known as The Whimsical Sketching of a Lightning Drawing. Méliès's drawing sketch was a forerunner of the animated cartoon. Méliès'",

In his Considerations on Representative Government, John Stuart Mill observed the complete marginalisation of workmen's voices in Parliament, rhetorically asking whether its members ever empathise with the position of workmen, instead of siding entirely with their masters, on issues such as the right to go on strike. Later in the book, he argues that an important function of truly representative government is to provide a relatively equal balance of power between workmen and masters, in order to prevent threats to the good of the whole of society. During Mill's discussion of the merits of progressive taxation in his essay Utilitarianism, he notes as an aside the power of the rich as independent of state support:\"People feel obliged to argue that the State does more for the rich than for the poor, as a justification for its taking more [in taxation] from them: though this is in reality not true, for the rich would be far better able to protect themselves, in the absence of law or government, than the poor, and indeed would probably be successful in converting the poor into their slaves.\"",

Weber argued that classes come from the different property locations. Different locations can largely affect one's class by their education and the people they associate with. He also stated that prestige results in different status groupings. This prestige is based upon the social status of one's parents. Prestige is an attributed value and many times cannot be changed. Weber stated that power differences led to the formation of political parties. Weber disagreed with Marx about the formation of classes. While Marx believed that groups are similar due to their economic status, Weber argued that classes are largely formed by social status. Weber did not believe that communities are formed by economic standing, but by similar social prestige. Weber did recognize that there is a relationship between social status, social prestige and classes.",

He later published PET studies of remitted opiate addicts which showed that cognitive deficits, negative affect, and abnormal glucose metabolism present during active drug use persisted for months and years after detoxification from methadone. With Dr. Lisa Cohen, Galynker later showed that behavioral sex addicts, such as male pedophiles, had deficits in glucose metabolism in the temporal cortex and severe character pathology that was similar but broader and more pronounced than that of the opiate-dependent subjects. In a subsequent series of reports, Cohen and Galynker described character pathology of pedophiles and other sex offenders and proposed a model for the etiology of pedophilic behavior.",

Its 40 barracks housed five thousand French prisoners of war captured during the Battle of France. According to Robert Christophe, in his making-of booklet on the film, Oflag XVII-A had a Gaullist resistance group called \"La Maffia\", which had ties to a French Resistance group (apparently the only such collaboration between prisoners outside France and resistance inside it), and thus acquired the materials for the camera (and supplies for escape attempts). Taking advantage of humanitarian packages from France, the prisoners smuggled in materials necessary for the construction and operation of a camera. Film was sent from France in packets with food for prisoners; they were hidden in sausages and other foods, and after being developed the negatives were hidden in the heels of the prisoners' boots (the footage documents such detail). Fourteen rolls were filmed by March 1945. The camera was made from a wooden box, which was hidden in a Larousse dictionary; the spine of this dictionary was capable of being opened like a shutter.",

In 1573, he was teaching at the Michaelisschule in Lüneburg; and on 23 June, by his own account, the political future of Europe was revealed to him in a vision. From then on, Grebner concentrated on prophecy and took up residence in Magdeburg. He intended the first copy of his work for Eric II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. On the way to see Augustus, Elector of Saxony, he was not far from Dresden when it came to him that he ought to write about the new star SN 1572. In 1582, Grebner was in England and presented Elizabeth I with a manuscript copy of his major work, Sericum Mundi filum. It went to the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, where it remains. There is some evidence that the French diplomat Jacques de Ségur-Pardaillan knew the prophecies a few years later. Grebner probably died in Hamburg.",

In the Interregnum, the Grebner prophecy was much contested, particularly by William Lilly, and was adopted by Fifth Monarchists. A brief description of the future history of Europe (1650) claimed to be based on the manuscript.

He concluded that the sea was once dry and that the shells were the remains of the animals that had lived there. This was the first recorded observation of the fossil record.
